<p>MILONIC DHTML MENU RELEASE 5.0 MENU DESIGN <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+----------------+ <br>
| Building Menus | <br>
+----------------+ <br>
<br>
Menus are built by manually editing a plain text file: menu_data.js. A good <br>
quality text editor is an essential tool for this purpose. Notepad will work but
<br>
does have issues.<br>
<br>
When building your own menus it's always better to use copy and paste. This way,
<br>
your syntax errors are reduced and typing is kept to a minimum.<br>
<br>
Menu builders are currently being worked on, but in the mean time the only way
<br>
to build menus is with a plain text editor.<br>
<br>
Once you have your downloaded menu working on your development environment you
<br>
can begin editing the menu_data.js file.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+-------------+ <br>
| Menu Styles | <br>
+-------------+ <br>
<br>
The visible properties of menus, such as colors and fonts, etc., are declared
<br>
within menu styles. These need to go at the top of your menu definition file, 
or, <br>
at the very least, be positioned before the first menu that uses the style is
<br>
declared.<br>
<br>
The object definition for a style is in this format:<br>
<br>
with(myMenuStyle=new mm_style()){ <br>
PARAMETERS. . . . <br>
PARAMETERS. . . . <br>
} <br>
<br>
This will create a style object called myMenuStyle that can be used in as many
<br>
menus as required. Parameters are declared within style objects in a 2 pair <br>
format: NAME=&quot;PROPERTY&quot;. This allows for a very flexible method of property <br>
declaration. There are no rules about the position of properties within the <br>
style object definition, and as long as the property is recognized it will be
<br>
used. If the system does not recognize a property it will simply ignore it.<br>
<br>
Note: You can declare as many menu styles as you need.<br>
<br>
Let's say that we wanted our menu items to have a black background and white <br>
text. In order to do this, we would declare 2 properties within the style object
<br>
- offbgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot; and offcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;.<br>
<br>
For the mouseOver colors we would declare onbgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; and <br>
oncolor=&quot;#000000&quot;. This would create a black menu with white text, and as each
<br>
menu item was moused over would change the color to white background with black
<br>
text. <br>
<br>
Note: You can use color names, but it isn't compatible with older browsers and
<br>
isn't recommended.<br>
<br>
With the parameters declared inside our style object definition, it would look
<br>
something like this:<br>
<br>
with(myMenuStyle=new mm_style()){ <br>
onbgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;; <br>
oncolor=&quot;#000000&quot;; <br>
offbgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot;; <br>
offcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;; <br>
} <br>
<br>
Note the addition of semi-colons after each property definition. This is not a
<br>
mandatory requirement in JavaScript and is optional, and merely denotes a new
<br>
line.<br>
<br>
In order to customize the menus style even further, you would add more style <br>
properties to the style object. Here is a list of the available style properties
<br>
that you can declare inside a style object:<br>
<br>
align <br>
bordercolor <br>
borderstyle <br>
borderwidth <br>
decoration <br>
fontfamily <br>
fontsize <br>
fontstyle <br>
fontweight <br>
headerbgcolor <br>
headercolor <br>
high3dcolor <br>
image <br>
low3dcolor <br>
offbgcolor <br>
offborder <br>
offclass <br>
offcolor <br>
onbgcolor <br>
onbold <br>
onborder <br>
onclass <br>
oncolor <br>
ondecoration <br>
onitalic <br>
onsubimage <br>
outfilter <br>
overfilter <br>
padding <br>
pagebgcolor <br>
pagecolor <br>
pageimage <br>
separatoralign <br>
separatorcolor <br>
separatorheight <br>
separatorpadding <br>
separatorsize <br>
separatorwidth <br>
subimage <br>
subimagepadding <br>
subimageposition <br>
<br>
More details about each property can be found here: <br>
http://www.milonic.com/styleproperties.php<br>
<br>
Note that each property must be enclosed in quotes unless it is completely <br>
numeric. 10px will need to be &quot;10px&quot;, but 10 will be fine without the quotes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

| Menus | <br>
+-------+ <br>
<br>
Now that you have declared your styles you can create some menus.<br>
<br>
The Milonic DHTML Menu is NOT a hierarchical menu system, and each menu is <br>
classed as equal. The way the menu works is by setting one or more menus to be
<br>
&quot;Always Visible&quot;. Your sub menus then fall off this main menu and display as <br>
required.<br>
<br>
Normally, your main menu is the first menu that you would declare. Although this
<br>
is not a mandatory requirement, it just makes the menu data file easier to <br>
understand when you come back to it in a year or two.<br>
<br>
To declare our first menu we have to include the properties inside a Menu object
<br>
definition. Here is a menu object definition:<br>
<br>
with(milonic=new menuname(&quot;mainmenu&quot;)){ <br>
PARAMETERS. . . . <br>
PARAMETERS. . . . <br>
} <br>
<br>
This creates a new menu called &quot;mainmenu&quot;. Within this object we will need to
<br>
declare a few parameters. One of them is telling the menu to be visible at all
<br>
times. The &quot;alwaysvisible&quot; property is used for this purpose. This property is a
<br>
logic property, and to enable this property it must be equal to 1. So, <br>
alwaysvisible=1; is what we need.<br>
<br>
As this menu will be visible at all times, it will need to be positioned on your
<br>
HTML page in the correct place relative to other HTML objects on your page. By
<br>
default, all menus are positioned absolute, and, therefore, we will need to give
<br>
this menu a TOP and a LEFT position. If we want this menu to be positioned 10
<br>
pixels down and 10 pixels across we would use top=10; and left=10;. <br>
<br>
Finally, we need to declare the style we want to use for this menu. Style is a
<br>
mandatory value that ALL menus must contain. All other properties can be omitted
<br>
if need be.<br>
<br>
Our new menu object definition should look something like this.<br>
<br>
with(milonic=new menuname(&quot;mainmenu&quot;)){ <br>
syle=myMenuStyle; <br>
alwaysvisible=1; <br>
left=10; <br>
top=10; <br>
} <br>
<br>
The available properties for use within a menu object definition are: <br>
<br>
name <br>
top <br>
left <br>
itemwidth <br>
borderwidth <br>
screenposition <br>
style <br>
alwaysvisible <br>
align <br>
borderstyle <br>
orientation <br>
keepalive <br>
overallwidth <br>
openstyle <br>
openonclick <br>
bordercolor <br>
bgimage <br>
scrollable <br>
margin <br>
overflow <br>
position <br>
overfilter <br>
outfilter <br>
itemheight <br>
followscroll <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

| Menu Items | <br>
+------------+ <br>
<br>
Now that you have an idea of how to add a menu, you need to know how to add menu
<br>
items. After all, a menu will not show anything without menu items, so it's 
vital <br>
to get a list of menu items inside the menu definition.<br>
<br>
Menu items need to be added after the menu properties have been declared. The
<br>
order is quite important for menus. The Menu properties first, then menu items.<br>
<br>
Menu items are added using a special function embedded within the menu object
<br>
definition. The function is aI() (case sensitive), and all menu item parameters
<br>
are passed within a text string.<br>
<br>
For example, to include a menu item that will take the user back to the home <br>
page, but does not open a sub menu, you would declare a menu item like this:<br>
<br>
aI(&quot;text=home;url=/index.html&quot;); <br>
<br>
This is perhaps the simplest of menu items that only has two properties, text
<br>
and url. The text property declares the text that will be displayed inside the
<br>
menu item, and the url is the page that the user will go to if he or she clicks
<br>
on the menu item.<br>
<br>
Note: All properties are included inside a single text string, separated by a
<br>
semi colon. Properties can also be added in any order. This makes building menus
<br>
easier than using conventional array values. With arrays, even if the value is
<br>
omitted, you still need to separate the array element with a comma. Plus, they
<br>
need to be in the correct order. This is not the case with the Milonic DHTML <br>
Menu. Any order will do, and if a value is not required you just delete it. The
<br>
menu will automatically use the default value.<br>
<br>
There are instances, however, when you may want to add HTML Entities such as <br>
&amp;nbsp;. This would normally cause a problem due to the addition of a semi colon.
<br>
However, the menu is smart enough to know that &amp;nbsp; is not the end of the <br>
parameter, and will include it, leaving you with nothing more to do if you need 
to <br>
add HTML Entities. In addition to this, if you did declare text that was a <br>
little too much for the Menu parser to work out, you could enclose your 
parameter <br>
inside back quotes. This is useful for including HTML within a menu item for a
<br>
form, etc.<br>
<br>
aI(&quot;text=`&lt;form style=\&quot;prop:val;\&quot;&gt;&lt;input name=txt&gt;&lt;/form&gt;`;&quot;);<br>
<br>
Is one example of how you would use back quotes. <br>
<br>
In order to get the menu item to open a sub menu, you need to declare the name 
of <br>
the menu that you want associated with the menu item. The showmenu parameter is
<br>
used for this. The following sample shows how the Home link could also open a
<br>
submenu:<br>
<br>
aI(&quot;text=home;url=/index.html;showmenu=submenu;&quot;); <br>
<br>
Again, any order of the above properties is perfectly acceptable, and, as you 
can <br>
see, to add more properties, you just need to include the value within the aI
<br>
text string separated by a semi colon.<br>
<br>
The list of properties for menu items is: <br>
<br>
text <br>
url <br>
showmenu <br>
status <br>
onbgcolor <br>
oncolor <br>
offbgcolor <br>
offcolor <br>
offborder <br>
separatorcolor <br>
padding <br>
fontsize <br>
fontstyle <br>
fontweight <br>
fontfamily <br>
high3dcolor <br>
low3dcolor <br>
pagecolor <br>
pagebgcolor <br>
headercolor <br>
headerbgcolor <br>
subimagepadding <br>
subimageposition <br>
subimage <br>
onborder <br>
ondecoration <br>
separatorsize <br>
itemheight <br>
image <br>
imageposition <br>
imagealign <br>
overimage <br>
decoration <br>
type <br>
target <br>

imageheight <br>
imagewidth <br>
openonclick <br>
closeonclick <br>
keepalive <br>
onfunction <br>

onbold <br>
onitalic <br>
bgimage <br>
overbgimage <br>
onsubimage <br>
separatorheight <br>
separatorwidth <br>
separatorpadding <br>
separatoralign <br>
onclass <br>
offclass <br>
itemwidth <br>
pageimage <br>
targetfeatures <br>
<br>
<br>
The following is a sample menu that includes several menu items.<br>
<br>
with(milonic=new menuname(&quot;mainmenu&quot;)){ <br>
style=myMenuStyle; <br>
alwaysvisible=1; <br>
left=10; <br>
top=10; <br>
aI(&quot;text=Home;url=/index.html;&quot;); <br>
aI(&quot;text=About Us;url=/aboutus.html;showmenu=About Us;&quot;); <br>
aI(&quot;text=Contact Us;url=/contactus.html;showmenu=contact;&quot;); <br>
aI(&quot;text=Google;url=http://www.google.com/index.html;&quot;); <br>
} <br>
<br>
In order to build your menu up you could copy and paste the above, making <br>
modifications as required.<br>
