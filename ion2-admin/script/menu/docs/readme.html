<br>
<br>
+--------------+ <br>
| Introduction | <br>
+--------------+ <br>
<br>
The Milonic DHTML Menu is a feature rich, cross browser DHTML website navigation
<br>
system.<br>
<br>
Several years of constant development have created one of the best website <br>
navigation systems currently available. The main use of the DHTML Menu is to <br>
allow for single click navigation of websites, Intranets, Extranets, and 
CD-ROMS. <br>
Normally navigation is from within a home page, but can be from anywhere within
<br>
either the user's website or from another website on the Internet. Object <br>
oriented menu data definition files assist in easy modification of custom <br>
menus. This allows for menus to be built easily from databases or XML. <br>
<br>

| Installation | <br>
+--------------+ <br>
<br>
Installation is very easy, but there are a few traps that you'll need to watch
<br>
out for. More details on installing the menu can be found in the INSTALL file.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+---------------+ <br>
| Example usage | <br>
+---------------+ <br>
<br>
All menus are built using the default menu_data.js file that accompanies this
<br>
download. This is the file you will edit in order to build and design your menu
<br>
for your own website or Intranet, etc. We recommend a good quality plain text
<br>
editor. Notepad will work but does have issues.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+-------+ <br>
| Notes | <br>
+-------+ <br>
<br>
Menus that are too long for the browser window will be given scroll bars to <br>
assist in creating a viewable area, even though the menu would have been hidden.
<br>
Delayed menu opening enables the menu to operate more accurately and appear to
<br>
function in the same way as conventional menus on most operating systems. Every
<br>
aspect of the menu can be modified both at runtime and build-time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+---------------+ <br>
| Compatibility | <br>
+---------------+ <br>
<br>
The menu is written in JavaScript and will support the following web browsers:<br>
<br>
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0+ on all Microsoft Windows Systems <br>

+---------------------+ <br>
| What Is JavaScript? | <br>
+---------------------+ <br>
<br>
JavaScript is Netscape's cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. <br>
Core JavaScript contains a core set of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
<br>
and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
<br>
statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by <br>
supplementing it with additional objects; for example:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
+------------------------+ <br>
| Client-Side JavaScript | <br>
+------------------------+ <br>
<br>
Web browsers such as Navigator (2.0 and later versions) can interpret client-<br>
side JavaScript statements embedded in an HTML page. When the browser (or <br>
client) requests such a page, the server sends the full content of the document,
<br>
including HTML and JavaScript statements, over the network to the client. The
<br>
browser reads the page from top to bottom, displaying the results of the HTML
<br>
and executing JavaScript statements as they are encountered.<br>
